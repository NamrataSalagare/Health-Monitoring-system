# Microcontroller-based-Health-Monitoring-system
Smart air monitoring system for asthma patients:
This Project provides a portable device integrated with an GSM 
module that monitors the environmental factors faced by asthma 
patients as well as their health parameters and transmits this data to 
the cloud. These parameters are typically measured using different 
sensors such as temperature and humidity sensor, gas sensor and 
pulse rate sensor.
